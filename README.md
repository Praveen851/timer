## list of assumptions made during development:
1. Categories can be infinite and are not predefined.
2. Every timer should be manually started after creation, hence all the timerâ€™s status will be set to pause initially and after reset.
3. For each timer created, a unique id is required.
4. Timer functionality is achieved through setInterval and so it should be cleared using clearInterval if the timer is paused or reset.
